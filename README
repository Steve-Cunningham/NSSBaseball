This branch contains my personal index.html & beerleague.js files as of 3/6/13.  

Code successfully adds & deletes teams from the Backlift server, with team info stored & displayed as a popover in the 
Standings div. Games are automatically populated in the schedule tabs by week from the 6-team schedule array and 
winner/loser of games is determined, however scores are not yet set up to be reported and stored on the server.

To do:
* Successfully get the app to bypass empty score fields
* Send W/L game results to server 
* add sorting function to standings
* add variable for 4 & 8 team league schedules
